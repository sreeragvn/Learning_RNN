Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold\\nyour selfe\\n\\n Bar. Long liue the King\\n\\n Fran. Barnardo?\\nBar. He\\n\\n Fran. You come most carefully vpon your houre\\n\\n Bar. 'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed Francisco\\n\\n Fran. For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold,\\nAnd I am sicke at heart\\n\\n Barn. Haue you had quiet Guard?\\nFran. Not a Mouse stirring\\n\\n Barn. Well, goodnight. If you do meet Horatio and\\nMarcellus, the Riuals of my Watch, bid them make hast.\\nEnter Horatio and Marcellus.\\n\\n Fran. I thinke I heare them. Stand: who's there?\\nHor. Friends to this ground\\n\\n Mar. And Leige-men to the Dane\\n\\n Fran. Giue you good night\\n\\n Mar. O farwel honest Soldier, who hath relieu'd you?\\nFra. Barnardo ha's my place: giue you goodnight.\\n\\nExit Fran.\\n\\n Mar. Holla Barnardo\\n\\n Bar. Say, what is Horatio there?\\nHor. A peece of him\\n\\n Bar. Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellus\\n\\n Mar. What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night\\n\\n Bar. I haue seene nothing\\n\\n Mar. Horatio saies, 'tis but our Fantasie,\\nAnd will not let beleefe take hold of him\\nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,\\nTherefore I haue intreated him along\\nWith vs, to watch the minutes of this Night,\\nThat if againe this Apparition come,\\nHe may approue our eyes, and speake to it\\n\\n Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare\\n\\n Bar. Sit downe a-while,\\nAnd let vs once againe assaile your eares,\\nThat are so fortified against our Story,\\nWhat we two Nights haue seene\\n\\n Hor. Well, sit we downe,\\nAnd let vs heare Barnardo speake of this\\n\\n Barn. Last night of all,\\nWhen yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole\\nHad made his course t' illume that part of Heauen\\nWhere now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe,\\nThe Bell then beating one\\n\\n Mar. Peace, breake thee of:\\nEnter the Ghost.\\n\\nLooke where it comes againe\\n\\n Barn. In the same figure, like the King that's dead\\n\\n Mar. Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio\\n\\n Barn. Lookes it not like the King? Marke it Horatio\\n\\n Hora. Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder\\nBarn. It would be spoke too\\n\\n Mar. Question it Horatio\\n\\n Hor. What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,\\nTogether with that Faire and Warlike forme\\nIn which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke\\nDid sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake\\n\\n Mar. It is offended\\n\\n Barn. See, it stalkes away\\n\\n Hor. Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.\\n\\nExit the Ghost.\\n\\n Mar. 'Tis gone, and will not answer\\n\\n Barn. How now Horatio? You tremble & look pale:\\nIs not this something more then Fantasie?\\nWhat thinke you on't?\\nHor. Before my God, I might not this beleeue\\nWithout the sensible and true auouch\\nOf mine owne eyes\\n\\n Mar. Is it not like the King?\\nHor. As thou art to thy selfe,\\nSuch was the very Armour he had on,\\nWhen th' Ambitious Norwey combatted:\\nSo frown'd he once, when in an angry parle\\nHe smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.\\n'Tis strange\\n\\n Mar. Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,\\nWith Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch\\n\\n Hor. In what particular thought to work, I know not:\\nBut in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,\\nThis boades some strange erruption to our State\\n\\n Mar. Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes\\nWhy this same strict and most obseruant Watch,\\nSo nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,\\nAnd why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon\\nAnd Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:\\nWhy such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske\\nDo's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,\\nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty hast\\nDoth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:\\nWho is't that can informe me?\\nHor. That can I,\\nAt least the whisper goes so: Our last King,\\nWhose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,\\nWas (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway,\\n(Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)\\nDar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet,\\n(For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)\\nDid slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,\\nWell ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,\\nDid forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands\\nWhich he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:\\nAgainst the which, a Moity competent\\nWas gaged by our King: which had return'd\\nTo the Inheritance of Fortinbras,\\nHad he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant\\nAnd carriage of the Article designe,\\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras,\\nOf vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,\\nHath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,\\nShark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,\\nFor Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize\\nThat hath a stomacke in't: which is no other\\n(And it doth well appeare vnto our State)\\nBut to recouer of vs by strong hand\\nAnd termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands\\nSo by his Father lost: and this (I take it)\\nIs the maine Motiue of our Preparations,\\nThe Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head\\nOf this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.\\nEnter Ghost againe.\\n\\nBut soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:\\nIle crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion:\\nIf thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,\\nSpeake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,\\nThat may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.\\nIf thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate\\n(Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.\\nOr, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life\\nExtorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,\\n(For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)\\nSpeake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus\\n\\n Mar. Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?\\nHor. Do, if it will not stand\\n\\n Barn. 'Tis heere\\n\\n Hor. 'Tis heere\\n\\n Mar. 'Tis gone.\\n\\nExit Ghost.\\n\\nWe do it wrong, being so Maiesticall\\nTo offer it the shew of Violence,\\nFor it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,\\nAnd our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery\\n\\n Barn. It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew\\n\\n Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing\\nVpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,\\nThe Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,\\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate\\nAwake the God of Day: and at his warning,\\nWhether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,\\nTh' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes\\nTo his Confine. And of the truth heerein,\\nThis present Obiect made probation\\n\\n Mar. It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.\\nSome sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes\\nWherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,\\nThe Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:\\nAnd then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,\\nThe nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,\\nNo Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:\\nSo hallow'd, and so gracious is the time\\n\\n Hor. So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.\\nBut looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,\\nWalkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,\\nBreake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice\\nLet vs impart what we haue seene to night\\nVnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,\\nThis Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:\\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\\nAs needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?\\nMar. Let do't I pray, and I this morning know\\nWhere we shall finde him most conueniently.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nScena Secunda.\\n\\nEnter Claudius King of Denmarke, Gertrude the Queene, Hamlet,\\nPolonius,\\nLaertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant.\\n\\n King. Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death\\nThe memory be greene: and that it vs befitted\\nTo beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome\\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe:\\nYet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,\\nThat we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,\\nTogether with remembrance of our selues.\\nTherefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,\\nTh' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,\\nHaue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,\\nWith one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,\\nWith mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,\\nIn equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole\\nTaken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd\\nYour better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone\\nWith this affaire along, for all our Thankes.\\nNow followes, that you know young Fortinbras,\\nHolding a weake supposall of our worth;\\nOr thinking by our late deere Brothers death,\\nOur State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,\\nColleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;\\nHe hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,\\nImporting the surrender of those Lands\\nLost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law\\nTo our most valiant Brother. So much for him.\\nEnter Voltemand and Cornelius.\\n\\nNow for our selfe, and for this time of meeting\\nThus much the businesse is. We haue heere writ\\nTo Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras,\\nWho Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares\\nOf this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse\\nHis further gate heerein. In that the Leuies,\\nThe Lists, and full proportions are all made\\nOut of his subiect: and we heere dispatch\\nYou good Cornelius, and you Voltemand,\\nFor bearing of this greeting to old Norway,\\nGiuing to you no further personall power\\nTo businesse with the King, more then the scope\\nOf these dilated Articles allow:\\nFarewell, and let your hast commend your duty\\n\\n Volt. In that, and all things, will we shew our duty\\n\\n King. We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.\\n\\nExit Voltemand and Cornelius.\\n\\nAnd now Laertes, what's the newes with you?\\nYou told vs of some suite. What is't Laertes?\\nYou cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,\\nAnd loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes,\\nThat shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?\\nThe Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,\\nThe Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth,\\nThen is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.\\nWhat would'st thou haue Laertes?\\nLaer. Dread my Lord,\\nYour leaue and fauour to returne to France,\\nFrom whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke\\nTo shew my duty in your Coronation,\\nYet now I must confesse, that duty done,\\nMy thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,\\nAnd bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon\\n\\n King. Haue you your Fathers leaue?\\nWhat sayes Pollonius?\\nPol. He hath my Lord:\\nI do beseech you giue him leaue to go\\n\\n King. Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine,\\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will:\\nBut now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?\\nHam. A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde\\n\\n King. How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?\\nHam. Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun\\n\\n Queen. Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,\\nAnd let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.\\nDo not for euer with thy veyled lids\\nSeeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;\\nThou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,\\nPassing through Nature, to Eternity\\n\\n Ham. I Madam, it is common\\n\\n Queen. If it be;\\nWhy seemes it so particular with thee\\n\\n Ham. Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:\\n'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)\\nNor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,\\nNor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,\\nNo, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,\\nNor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,\\nTogether with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,\\nThat can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,\\nFor they are actions that a man might play:\\nBut I haue that Within, which passeth show;\\nThese, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe\\n\\n King. 'Tis sweet and commendable\\nIn your Nature Hamlet,\\nTo giue these mourning duties to your Father:\\nBut you must know, your Father lost a Father,\\nThat Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound\\nIn filiall Obligation, for some terme\\nTo do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer\\nIn obstinate Condolement, is a course\\nOf impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,\\nIt shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,\\nA Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,\\nAn Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:\\nFor, what we know must be, and is as common\\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sence,\\nWhy should we in our peeuish Opposition\\nTake it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,\\nA fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,\\nTo Reason most absurd, whose common Theame\\nIs death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,\\nFrom the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,\\nThis must be so. We pray you throw to earth\\nThis vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs\\nAs of a Father; For let the world take note,\\nYou are the most immediate to our Throne,\\nAnd with no lesse Nobility of Loue,\\nThen that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,\\nDo I impart towards you. For your intent\\nIn going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,\\nIt is most retrograde to our desire:\\nAnd we beseech you, bend you to remaine\\nHeere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,\\nOur cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne\\n\\n Qu. Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:\\nI prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg\\n\\n Ham. I shall in all my best\\nObey you Madam\\n\\n King. Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,\\nBe as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,\\nThis gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet\\nSits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,\\nNo iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,\\nBut the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,\\nAnd the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,\\nRespeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nManet Hamlet.\\n\\n Ham. Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,\\nThaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:\\nOr that the Euerlasting had not fixt\\nHis Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!\\nHow weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable\\nSeemes to me all the vses of this world?\\nFie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden\\nThat growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature\\nPossesse it meerely. That it should come to this:\\nBut two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,\\nSo excellent a King, that was to this\\nHiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,\\nThat he might not beteene the windes of heauen\\nVisit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth\\nMust I remember: why she would hang on him,\\nAs if encrease of Appetite had growne\\nBy what is fed on; and yet within a month?\\nLet me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.\\nA little Month, or ere those shooes were old,\\nWith which she followed my poore Fathers body\\nLike Niobe, all teares. Why she, euen she.\\n(O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of Reason\\nWould haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,\\nMy Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,\\nThen I to Hercules. Within a Moneth?\\nEre yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares\\nHad left the flushing of her gauled eyes,\\nShe married. O most wicked speed, to post\\nWith such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:\\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good.\\nBut breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.\\nEnter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.\\n\\n Hor. Haile to your Lordship\\n\\n Ham. I am glad to see you well:\\nHoratio, or I do forget my selfe\\n\\n Hor. The same my Lord,\\nAnd your poore Seruant euer\\n\\n Ham. Sir my good friend,\\nIle change that name with you:\\nAnd what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?\\nMarcellus\\n\\n Mar. My good Lord\\n\\n Ham. I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.\\nBut what in faith make you from Wittemberge?\\nHor. A truant disposition, good my Lord\\n\\n Ham. I would not haue your Enemy say so;\\nNor shall you doe mine eare that violence,\\nTo make it truster of your owne report\\nAgainst your selfe. I know you are no Truant:\\nBut what is your affaire in Elsenour?\\nWee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart\\n\\n Hor. My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall\\n\\n Ham. I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student)\\nI thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding\\n\\n Hor. Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon\\n\\n Ham. Thrift thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meats\\nDid coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;\\nWould I had met my dearest foe in heauen,\\nEre I had euer seene that day Horatio.\\nMy father, me thinkes I see my father\\n\\n Hor. Oh where my Lord?\\nHam. In my minds eye (Horatio)\\nHor. I saw him once; he was a goodly King\\n\\n Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all:\\nI shall not look vpon his like againe\\n\\n Hor. My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight\\n\\n Ham. Saw? Who?\\nHor. My Lord, the King your Father\\n\\n Ham. The King my Father?\\nHor. Season your admiration for a while\\nWith an attent eare; till I may deliuer\\nVpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,\\nThis maruell to you\\n\\n Ham. For Heauens loue let me heare\\n\\n Hor. Two nights together, had these Gentlemen\\n(Marcellus and Barnardo) on their Watch\\nIn the dead wast and middle of the night\\nBeene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,\\nArm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,\\nAppeares before them, and with sollemne march\\nGoes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,\\nBy their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,\\nWithin his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd\\nAlmost to Ielly with the Act of feare,\\nStand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me\\nIn dreadfull secrecie impart they did,\\nAnd I with them the third Night kept the Watch,\\nWhereas they had deliuer'd both in time,\\nForme of the thing; each word made true and good,\\nThe Apparition comes. I knew your Father:\\nThese hands are not more like\\n\\n Ham. But where was this?\\nMar. My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht\\n\\n Ham. Did you not speake to it?\\nHor. My Lord, I did;\\nBut answere made it none: yet once me thought\\nIt lifted vp it head, and did addresse\\nIt selfe to motion, like as it would speake:\\nBut euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;\\nAnd at the sound it shrunke in hast away,\\nAnd vanisht from our sight\\n\\n Ham. Tis very strange\\n\\n Hor. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;\\nAnd we did thinke it writ downe in our duty\\nTo let you know of it\\n\\n Ham. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.\\nHold you the watch to Night?\\nBoth. We doe my Lord\\n\\n Ham. Arm'd, say you?\\nBoth. Arm'd, my Lord\\n\\n Ham. From top to toe?\\nBoth. My Lord, from head to foote\\n\\n Ham. Then saw you not his face?\\nHor. O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp\\n\\n Ham. What, lookt he frowningly?\\nHor. A countenance more in sorrow then in anger\\n\\n Ham. Pale, or red?\\nHor. Nay very pale\\n\\n Ham. And fixt his eyes vpon you?\\nHor. Most constantly\\n\\n Ham. I would I had beene there\\n\\n Hor. It would haue much amaz'd you\\n\\n Ham. Very like, very like: staid it long?\\nHor. While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred\\n\\n All. Longer, longer\\n\\n Hor. Not when I saw't\\n\\n Ham. His Beard was grisly? no\\n\\n Hor. It was, as I haue seene it in his life,\\nA Sable Siluer'd\\n\\n Ham. Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe\\n\\n Hor. I warrant you it will\\n\\n Ham. If it assume my noble Fathers person,\\nIle speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape\\nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\\nIf you haue hitherto conceald this sight;\\nLet it bee treble in your silence still:\\nAnd whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,\\nGiue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;\\nI will requite your loues; so fare ye well:\\nVpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,\\nIle visit you\\n\\n All.

My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:\\nAnd Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,\\nAnd Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,\\nBut let me heare from you\\n\\n Ophel. Doe you doubt that?\\nLaer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his fauours,\\nHold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude;\\nA Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;\\nFroward, not permanent; sweet not lasting\\nThe suppliance of a minute? No more\\n\\n Ophel. No more but so\\n\\n Laer. Thinke it no more:\\nFor nature cressant does not grow alone,\\nIn thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,\\nThe inward seruice of the Minde and Soule\\nGrowes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,\\nAnd now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch\\nThe vertue of his feare: but you must feare\\nHis greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;\\nFor hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:\\nHee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,\\nCarue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends\\nThe sanctity and health of the whole State.\\nAnd therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd\\nVnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,\\nWhereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,\\nIt fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;\\nAs he in his peculiar Sect and force\\nMay giue his saying deed: which is no further,\\nThen the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.\\nThen weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,\\nIf with too credent eare you list his Songs;\\nOr lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open\\nTo his vnmastred importunity.\\nFeare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,\\nAnd keepe within the reare of your Affection;\\nOut of the shot and danger of Desire.\\nThe chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,\\nIf she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:\\nVertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,\\nThe Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring\\nToo oft before the buttons be disclos'd,\\nAnd in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,\\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\\nBe wary then, best safety lies in feare;\\nYouth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere\\n\\n Ophe.

He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders\\nOf his affection to me\\n\\n Polon. Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle,\\nVnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.\\nDoe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?\\nOphe. I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke\\n\\n Polon. Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,\\nThat you haue tane his tenders for true pay,\\nWhich are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;\\nOr not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,\\nRoaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole\\n\\n Ophe. My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,\\nIn honourable fashion\\n\\n Polon. I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too\\n\\n Ophe. And hath giuen countenance to his speech,\\nMy Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen\\n\\n Polon. I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe know\\nWhen the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule\\nGiues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,\\nGiuing more light then heate; extinct in both,\\nEuen in their promise, as it is a making;\\nYou must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,\\nBe somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;\\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate,\\nThen a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\\nBeleeue so much in him, that he is young,\\nAnd with a larger tether may he walke,\\nThen may be giuen you. In few, Ophelia,\\nDoe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,\\nNot of the eye, which their Inuestments show:\\nBut meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,\\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bonds,\\nThe better to beguile. This is for all:\\nI would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,\\nHaue you so slander any moment leisure,\\nAs to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:\\nLooke too't, I charge you; come your wayes\\n\\n Ophe. I shall obey my Lord.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nEnter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus.\\n\\n Ham. The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?\\nHor. It is a nipping and an eager ayre\\n\\n Ham.

Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,\\nWherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.\\nWhat does this meane my Lord?\\nHam. The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse,\\nKeepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,\\nAnd as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,\\nThe kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out\\nThe triumph of his Pledge\\n\\n Horat.

It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee\\n\\n Mar. You shall not goe my Lord\\n\\n Ham. Hold off your hand\\n\\n Hor. Be rul'd, you shall not goe\\n\\n Ham.

You shall doe maruels wisely: good Reynoldo,\\nBefore you visite him you make inquiry\\nOf his behauiour\\n\\n Reynol. My Lord, I did intend it\\n\\n Polon. Marry, well said;\\nVery well said. Looke you Sir,\\nEnquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;\\nAnd how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:\\nWhat company, at what expence: and finding\\nBy this encompassement and drift of question,\\nThat they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer\\nThen your particular demands will touch it,\\nTake you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,\\nAnd thus I know his father and his friends,\\nAnd in part him. Doe you marke this Reynoldo?\\nReynol. I, very well my Lord\\n\\n Polon. And in part him, but you may say not well;\\nBut if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;\\nAddicted so and so; and there put on him\\nWhat forgeries you please; marry, none so ranke,\\nAs may dishonour him; take heed of that:\\nBut Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,\\nAs are Companions noted and most knowne\\nTo youth and liberty\\n\\n Reynol. As gaming my Lord\\n\\n Polon. I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,\\nQuarelling, drabbing. You may goe so farre\\n\\n Reynol. My Lord that would dishonour him\\n\\n Polon. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;\\nYou must not put another scandall on him,\\nThat hee is open to Incontinencie;\\nThat's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,\\nThat they may seeme the taints of liberty;\\nThe flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,\\nA sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault\\n\\n Reynol. But my good Lord\\n\\n Polon. Wherefore should you doe this?\\nReynol. I my Lord, I would know that\\n\\n Polon. Marry Sir, heere's my drift,\\nAnd I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:\\nYou laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne,\\nAs 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:\\nMarke you your party in conuerse; him you would sound,\\nHauing euer seene. In the prenominate crimes,\\nThe youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd\\nHe closes with you in this consequence:\\nGood sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.\\nAccording to the Phrase and the Addition,\\nOf man and Country\\n\\n Reynol. Very good my Lord\\n\\n Polon. And then Sir does he this?\\nHe does: what was I about to say?\\nI was about say somthing: where did I leaue?\\nReynol. At closes in the consequence:\\nAt friend, or so, and Gentleman\\n\\n Polon. At closes in the consequence, I marry,\\nHe closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,\\nI saw him yesterday, or tother day;\\nOr then or then, with such and such; and as you say,\\nThere was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse,\\nThere falling out at Tennis; or perchance,\\nI saw him enter such a house of saile;\\nVidelicet, a Brothell, or so forth. See you now;\\nYour bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth;\\nAnd thus doe we of wisedome and of reach\\nWith windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,\\nBy indirections finde directions out:\\nSo by my former Lecture and aduice\\nShall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?\\nReynol. My Lord I haue\\n\\n Polon. God buy you; fare you well\\n\\n Reynol. Good my Lord\\n\\n Polon. Obserue his inclination in your selfe\\n\\n Reynol. I shall my Lord\\n\\n Polon.

Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted\\n\\n Polon. With what, in the name of Heauen?\\nOphe. My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,\\nLord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd,\\nNo hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,\\nVngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle,\\nPale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,\\nAnd with a looke so pitious in purport,\\nAs if he had been loosed out of hell,\\nTo speake of horrors: he comes before me\\n\\n Polon. Mad for thy Loue?\\nOphe. My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it\\n\\n Polon. What said he?\\nOphe. He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;\\nThen goes he to the length of all his arme;\\nAnd with his other hand thus o're his brow,\\nHe fals to such perusall of my face,\\nAs he would draw it. Long staid he so,\\nAt last, a little shaking of mine Arme:\\nAnd thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;\\nHe rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,\\nThat it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,\\nAnd end his being. That done, he lets me goe,\\nAnd with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,\\nHe seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,\\nFor out adores he went without their helpe;\\nAnd to the last, bended their light on me\\n\\n Polon. Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,\\nThis is the very extasie of Loue,\\nWhose violent property foredoes it selfe,\\nAnd leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,\\nAs oft as any passion vnder Heauen,\\nThat does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,\\nWhat haue you giuen him any hard words of late?\\nOphe. No my good Lord: but as you did command,\\nI did repell his Letters, and deny'de\\nHis accesse to me\\n\\n Pol. That hath made him mad.\\nI am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement\\nI had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,\\nAnd meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:\\nIt seemes it is as proper to our Age,\\nTo cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,\\nAs it is common for the yonger sort\\nTo lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King,\\nThis must be knowne, being kept close might moue\\nMore greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nScena Secunda.\\n\\nEnter King, Queene, Rosincrane, and Guildensterne Cum alijs.\\n\\n King.

But what might you think?\\nWhen I had seene this hot loue on the wing,\\nAs I perceiued it, I must tell you that\\nBefore my Daughter told me what might you\\nOr my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,\\nIf I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,\\nOr giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,\\nOr look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,\\nWhat might you thinke? No, I went round to worke,\\nAnd (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake\\nLord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre,\\nThis must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,\\nThat she should locke her selfe from his Resort,\\nAdmit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:\\nWhich done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,\\nAnd he repulsed.

Not that I know\\n\\n Pol. Take this from this; if this be otherwise,\\nIf Circumstances leade me, I will finde\\nWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeede\\nWithin the Center\\n\\n King. How may we try it further?\\nPol. You know sometimes\\nHe walkes foure houres together, heere\\nIn the Lobby\\n\\n Qu. So he ha's indeed\\n\\n Pol. At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,\\nBe you and I behinde an Arras then,\\nMarke the encounter: If he loue her not,\\nAnd be not from his reason falne thereon;\\nLet me be no Assistant for a State,\\nAnd keepe a Farme and Carters\\n\\n King.

Do you know me, my Lord?\\nHam. Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger\\n\\n Pol. Not I my Lord\\n\\n Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man\\n\\n Pol. Honest, my Lord?\\nHam. I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee\\none man pick'd out of two thousand\\n\\n Pol. That's very true, my Lord\\n\\n Ham. For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,\\nbeing a good kissing Carrion-\\nHaue you a daughter?\\nPol. I haue my Lord\\n\\n Ham. Let her not walke i'thSunne: Conception is a\\nblessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue. Friend\\nlooke too't\\n\\n Pol. How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter:\\nyet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger:\\nhe is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth,\\nI suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ile\\nspeake to him againe. What do you read my Lord?\\nHam. Words, words, words\\n\\n Pol. What is the matter, my Lord?\\nHam. Betweene who?\\nPol. I meane the matter you meane, my Lord\\n\\n Ham. Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,\\nthat old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled;\\ntheir eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-Tree\\nGumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit,\\ntogether with weake Hammes. All which Sir, though I\\nmost powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it\\nnot Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your\\nselfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you could\\ngo backward\\n\\n Pol. Though this be madnesse,\\nYet there is Method in't: will you walke\\nOut of the ayre my Lord?\\nHam. Into my Graue?\\nPol. Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre:\\nHow pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?\\nA happinesse,\\nThat often Madnesse hits on,\\nWhich Reason and Sanitie could not\\nSo prosperously be deliuer'd of.\\nI will leaue him,\\nAnd sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting\\nBetweene him, and my daughter.\\nMy Honourable Lord, I will most humbly\\nTake my leaue of you\\n\\n Ham. You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I\\nwill more willingly part withall, except my life, my\\nlife\\n\\n Polon. Fare you well my Lord\\n\\n Ham. These tedious old fooles\\n\\n Polon.

My excellent good friends? How do'st thou\\nGuildensterne? Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe ye\\nboth?\\nRosin. As the indifferent Children of the earth\\n\\n Guild. Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy: on Fortunes\\nCap, we are not the very Button\\n\\n Ham. Nor the Soales of her Shoo?\\nRosin. Neither my Lord\\n\\n Ham.

What's the newes?\\nRosin. None my Lord; but that the World's growne\\nhonest\\n\\n Ham. Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is\\nnot true. Let me question more in particular: what haue\\nyou my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,\\nthat she sends you to Prison hither?\\nGuil. Prison, my Lord?\\nHam. Denmark's a Prison\\n\\n Rosin. Then is the World one\\n\\n Ham. A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,\\nWards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'\\nworst\\n\\n Rosin. We thinke not so my Lord\\n\\n Ham. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing\\neither good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is\\na prison\\n\\n Rosin. Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis\\ntoo narrow for your minde\\n\\n Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and\\ncount my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that\\nI haue bad dreames\\n\\n Guil. Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the\\nvery substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow\\nof a Dreame\\n\\n Ham. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow\\n\\n Rosin. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and\\nlight a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow\\n\\n Ham. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs\\nand out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:\\nshall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?\\nBoth. Wee'l wait vpon you\\n\\n Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with the\\nrest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest\\nman: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten\\nway of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?\\nRosin. To visit you my Lord, no other occasion\\n\\n Ham. Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;\\nbut I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks\\nare too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is it\\nyour owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,\\ndeale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake\\n\\n Guil. What should we say my Lord?\\nHam. Why any thing. But to the purpose; you were\\nsent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;\\nwhich your modesties haue not craft enough to color,\\nI know the good King & Queene haue sent for you\\n\\n Rosin. To what end my Lord?\\nHam. That you must teach me: but let mee coniure\\nyou by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of\\nour youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue,\\nand by what more deare, a better proposer could charge\\nyou withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you\\nwere sent for or no\\n\\n Rosin. What say you?\\nHam. Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me\\nhold not off\\n\\n Guil. My Lord, we were sent for\\n\\n Ham. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\\npreuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and\\nQueene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore\\nI know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;\\nand indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition;\\nthat this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill\\nPromontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,\\nlook you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,\\nfretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing\\nto mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours.\\nWhat a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in\\nReason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing\\nhow expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel?\\nin apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of the\\nworld, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is\\nthis Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no,\\nnor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme\\nto say so\\n\\n Rosin. My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my\\nthoughts\\n\\n Ham. Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights\\nnot me?\\nRosin. To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,\\nwhat Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue\\nfrom you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are\\nthey comming to offer you Seruice\\n\\n Ham. He that playes the King shall be welcome; his\\nMaiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous\\nKnight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall\\nnot sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in\\npeace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs\\nare tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde\\nfreely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players\\nare they?\\nRosin. Euen those you were wont to take delight in\\nthe Tragedians of the City\\n\\n Ham. How chances it they trauaile? their residence\\nboth in reputation and profit was better both\\nwayes\\n\\n Rosin. I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes\\nof the late Innouation?\\nHam. Doe they hold the same estimation they did\\nwhen I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?\\nRosin. No indeed, they are not\\n\\n Ham. How comes it? doe they grow rusty?\\nRosin. Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted\\npace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little\\nYases, that crye out on the top of question; and\\nare most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the\\nfashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they\\ncall them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of\\nGoose-quils, and dare scarse come thither\\n\\n Ham. What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?\\nHow are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no\\nlonger then they can sing? Will they not say afterwards\\nif they should grow themselues to common Players (as\\nit is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers\\ndo them wrong, to make them exclaim against their\\nowne Succession\\n\\n Rosin. Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:\\nand the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie.\\nThere was for a while, no mony bid for argument,\\nvnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in\\nthe Question\\n\\n Ham. Is't possible?\\nGuild. Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of\\nBraines\\n\\n Ham. Do the Boyes carry it away?\\nRosin. I that they do my Lord. Hercules & his load too\\n\\n Ham. It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of\\nDenmarke, and those that would make mowes at him\\nwhile my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred\\nDucates a peece, for his picture in Little.

Come giue vs a tast of your quality:\\ncome, a passionate speech\\n\\n 1.Play. What speech, my Lord?\\nHam. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was\\nneuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I\\nremember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the\\nGenerall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose\\niudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an\\nexcellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe\\nwith as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said,\\nthere was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory;\\nnor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the\\nAuthor of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. One\\ncheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale\\nto Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks\\nof Priams slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at\\nthis Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus like\\nth'Hyrcanian Beast. It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus\\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes\\nBlacke as his purpose, did the night resemble\\nWhen he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,\\nHath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd\\nWith Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote\\nNow is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd\\nWith blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,\\nBak'd and impasted with the parching streets,\\nThat lend a tyrannous, and damned light\\nTo their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,\\nAnd thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,\\nWith eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\nOlde Grandsire Priam seekes\\n\\n Pol. Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,\\nand good discretion\\n\\n 1.Player. Anon he findes him,\\nStriking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword,\\nRebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles\\nRepugnant to command: vnequall match,\\nPyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:\\nBut with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,\\nTh' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium,\\nSeeming to feele his blow, with flaming top\\nStoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash\\nTakes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For loe, his Sword\\nWhich was declining on the Milkie head\\nOf Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:\\nSo as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,\\nAnd like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.\\nBut as we often see against some storme,\\nA silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,\\nThe bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below\\nAs hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder\\nDoth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause,\\nA rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,\\nAnd neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall\\nOn Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,\\nWith lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword\\nNow falles on Priam.\\nOut, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,\\nIn generall Synod take away her power:\\nBreake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,\\nAnd boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,\\nAs low as to the Fiends\\n\\n Pol. This is too long\\n\\n Ham. It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Prythee\\nsay on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee\\nsleepes. Say on; come to Hecuba\\n\\n 1.Play. But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen\\n\\n Ham. The inobled Queene?\\nPol. That's good: Inobled Queene is good\\n\\n 1.Play. Run bare-foot vp and downe,\\nThreatning the flame\\nWith Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,\\nWhere late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe\\nAbout her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,\\nA blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.\\nWho this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,\\n'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?\\nBut if the Gods themselues did see her then,\\nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\nIn mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,\\nThe instant Burst of Clamour that she made\\n(Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)\\nWould haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,\\nAnd passion in the Gods\\n\\n Pol. Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and\\nha's teares in's eyes.
